                    <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                    <p>The global response to the ever-continuing Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the different
                        priorities and
                        strategies for different countries. Throughout the world, measures were taken almost universally
                        to
                        reduce the transmission of the disease. Albeit, the nature and duration of precautions varied as
                        time
                        progressed. We saw some places like China, much of Europe, and New Zealand take measures that
                        maintained
                        extremely low rates and a quick recovery. However, some places, including the United States of
                        America,
                        have had a continued battle with trying to balance what the government can constitutionally
                        enforce in a
                        time of crisis and what the freedoms of its citizens are. </p>

                    <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                    <p>Focusing primarily on the social dynamic of the United States, there has been a clash
                        of social values.
                        The moral dilema stems from the national ideal that as free citizens, however
                        sometimes we must
                        sacrifice our liberities in the name of helping those around us. Additionally,
                        people in a fast-moving
                        consumerist society enjoy the ability to have a wide range of activities to enjoy
                        and a large network of
                        companions to interact with. The pandemic heavily altered our perception of what we
                        are able to do and
                        how we can do it. Currently, some people are still socially distancing themselves.
                        Meanwhile, others are
                        going back to living life in the same manner they did prior to the pandemic. How can
                        we balance
                        maintaining safety and enjoying our close comradeships?</p>

                    <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                    <p>The global market cetainly took a hit throughout the duration of the
                        pandemic. Business had to radically shift and all companies saw either
                        great improvements or degradations in their operations. Those that
                        improved were typically companies with either large online delivery capabilities or were
                        strictly an
                        online
                        service. Almost all businesses had some sort of difficulty in facing the pandemic and
                        stabalizing
                        their
                        structure. Nevertheless, businesses that were most negatively impacted by the pandemic were
                        small
                        businesses
                        that could not realitstically adapt so suddenly and so drastically.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The bottom line is that the pandemic is not over and neither are the effects that it had on our
                        political,
                        social, and economic systems. I think as a whole, this event demonstrated to all parties that
                        stability and
                        normality can fluctuate at any point in time without warning. Our world is unpredictable; all we
                        can
                        do is
                        adapt to unforeseen circusmtances to the best of our abilities. Politically, there is still a
                        great
                        divide,
                        especially within the United States on what the government is allowed to enforce and how its
                        citizens should
                        act. Socially, we must find ways to balance safety and personal livelihood. Economically, both
                        individuals
                        and corporations still must work diligently to recover. Every day is a learning experience. If
                        we do
                        not
                        adequetly find solutions to our dilemmas in the moments in which we have them, there is always
                        tomorrow. But
                        we must be open to trying new things and working hard to find alternatives to remedy our
                        circumstances. </p>
