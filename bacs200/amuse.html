            <h2>The longest sentence ever signed by a monkey</h2>
            <p>Nim Chimpsky was a monkey who was taught sign language in order to communicate with people. </p>
            <p>The longest recorded sentence from Nim was as follows: 
            <p>"Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you." </p>
            <p>There is an edited documentary video that (exaggeratingly) shows this sentence</p>
