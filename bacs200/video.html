            <div class="card-body p-5">
                <p>Hi, I'm Zach Montgomery and I'm currently a business major at the University of Northern
                    Colorado. My
                    emphasis is in
                    marketing and I'm also getting a minor in psychology. I've been taking business-related classes
                    since
                    I was in high
                    school and have even competed nationally in clubs such as FBLA and DECA. I'm currently taking a
                    web
                    development class to
                    learn how to find new ways to lay out projects, information, and details for clients. In the
                    past I've
                    created several
                    marketing campaigns for a few local businesses, including a pizzeria and a coffee shop. I'm
                    currently
                    doing marketing
                    analysis and research for Habitat for Humanity to discover and find new ways to help them do
                    business in their restores.
                    Additionally i've also been working throughout the past few years on increasing my fluency in
                    Microsoft Suites such as
                    Excel and Access. Some of my greatest skills are my ability to communicate, both verbally and
                    linguistically. Additionally
                    I have found many leadership roles throughout my life and I have come to find that I can often
                    work
                    well with other people
                    and take initiative when needed. I also can complete projects in an efficient manner and I know
                    how to
                    be vigilant and
                    aware of my surroundings and any project I need to complete. Moreover, whenever I'm committed to
                    a
                    project, task, or an
                    objective, I can devote large amounts of time to it without getting burnt out and I know how to
                    do it
                    in a manner in which I
                    can consistently give my best efforts.

                    Additionally, I have a large drive to exceed expectations. I like going above and beyond in all
                    areas
                    that I possibly can.
                    I'm also willing and ready to make sacrifices if I have to. I'm always prepared to give and do
                    so
                    without expecting much
                    in return. I also am really persistent and excited about learning new things. I think it's
                    difficult
                    to learn new things sometimes
                    and I often really like meeting the challenge head-on and I'll do whatever it takes to really
                    become comfortable
                    in whatever task it is I'm trying to figure out. Finally, I'm a very organized person I try to
                    keep my
                    room tidy, my mind
                    tidy, and I try to keep any office space or workspace as clean and professional as possible.
                    Thank you for your time,
                    have a wonderful day. </p>
