    <h1>My Hero is Danny Devito</h1>
    <p>Everyone has a different definition of what a hero is.</p> 
    <p>In my eyes, a hero is someone who makes the world a better place, no matter the method.</p>
    <p>And an astounding example of a hero who brings joy to the world merely through his existence is Danny Devito.</p>
    <p>Just look at this beautiful creature and tell me he isn't the meaning of joy!</p>
