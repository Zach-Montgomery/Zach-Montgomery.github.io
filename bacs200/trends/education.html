                <h3>Education</h3>
            </div>
            <p> The system of education has been somewhat stagnant in the ideals that it wishes to establish within
                those developing
                within society. Across the globe, STEM subjects are prioritized in industrialized nations while
                developing countries
                focus on teaching necessary duties and responsibilities that are needed to survive and upkeep social
                operations. Albeit,
                in developed countries, the forms through which education is delivered and the priorities of the
                curriculum are
                shifting. As schools had to adapt to online formats for lessons, the world has been seeing an
                ever-increasing adjustment
                towards virtual learning opportunities. While classrooms have long experimented with utilizing
                technology to further the
                capabilities of lesson plans, the impact of COVID-19 has caused a large gravitation towards online and
                electronic
                learning.</p>
            <p>Moreover, personalized learning environments for students have been gaining popularity. Called
                micro-schools or
                micro-pods, these classrooms focus on individual student needs. This trend allows for a more personal
                educational
                experience tailored to specific strengths and areas for improvement for students. Going hand in hand
                with this focus on
                education comes a desire to focus on cultivating creativity in the classroom. As professions shift from
                cut and dry
                processes to needs to think outside the box to solve complex problems, educators deem it essential to
                prepare students
                for how to think creatively. Furthermore, because of the place that expression and identity play into
                our daily lives as
                people, giving developing youths tools to find themselves in various ways has become a priority.
                Finally, educators are
                also trying to find more interactive means for students to learn. While traditional homework assignments
                still have
                their place, using technology to allow students to understand subject matter in new ways. <a
