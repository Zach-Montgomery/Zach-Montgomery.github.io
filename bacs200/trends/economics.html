                <h3>Economics</h3>
            </div>
            <p> Throughout the course of the current pandemic, global economies were highly impacted. Businesses and
                consumers alike
                were forced to radically shift in their behaviors and procedures. Many businesses became bankrupt and
                were forced to
                shut down amid these changes. Nevertheless, the future looks brighter. For one, the market is seeing
                regrowth. Stimulus
                checks caused an increase in consumer investments, and this will most likely continue as the world
                attempts to convert
                operations back to pre-COVID conditions. Nevertheless, with this increase in spending has come an
                increase in public
                debt. This will somewhat increase as buyers make large investments to attain goods and services on
                payment plans.
                Nevertheless, consumer income has seen a positive shift because of the increase in service industries
                and their
                concurrent need for qualified workers. This means that spending on non-essential products and services
                is going to rise.</p>
            <p>Additionally, businesses became much more focused on technological development and ways to innovate
                operations to be
                harmonious with social distancing procedures. As such, electronic practices that can reliably replace
                old-fashioned
                methods of conducting a business will be implemented more and more. E-commerce will also steadily
                increase in viability
                and usage as the world becomes more comfortable with the purchasing of goods and services online. With a
                newfound focus
                on digital means of growing the economy, cryptocurrency has rocketed in popularity and usability.
                Organizations will
                allow for more usage of cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services. Furthermore, companies around
                the world are
                expected to become more environmentally friendly as consumers push for socially responsible practices
                and efforts. <a
