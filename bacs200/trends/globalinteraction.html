                <h3>Global Interaction</h3>
            </div>
            <p> Within the past few decades, we have already seen exponential change in how we interact with one another
                globally in
                almost all facets of life. Business, recreation, friendships and other relationships, and communication
                in general have
                all been deeply impacted by internet and travel technology. This is a trend that is continuing, causing
                the world to
                become more and more accessible to everyone, everywhere. Businesses of all sizes, friends, and everyone
                in between are
                able to conduct meetings, send messages, and find data in seconds because of our current electronic
                infrastructure.
                Moreover, because of the continued interest in refining virtual reality technology, the possibilities
                for global
                interactions are being blown open. It is becoming increasingly plausible for people to be within reach
                of one another
                digitally while being completely physically separated.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, global interactions are being considered under the current conditions and effects of the
                COVID-19 pandemic.
                Are people going to be as inclined to physically visit one another? Are countries going to allow
                foreigners into their
                borders as easily as before? Is the world going to continue to become more open, or more restricted?
                Expert answers to
                these questions are actually somewhat inconclusive; there are qualified people arguing both sides.
                Albeit the majority
                of available information indicates that cultures around the world are going to become more selective on
                who has access
                to their countries. This was exacerbated by the pandemic, in which genuine trust for outside individuals
                dropped
                immensely. Moreover, with increased technological innovations, in-person interactions are becoming less
                sought after.
                The world is moving somewhat further apart, but it still intends to remain as connected as possible. <a
